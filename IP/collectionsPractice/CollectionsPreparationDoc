Collection Framework:
->Collection is a group of individual objects represented as a single unit
->Collection interface has two main root interfaces 
    1)java.util.Collection
    2)java.util.Map

->Before Collections or before JDk 1.2 to handle group of individual date been handled using arrays, vectors,Hashtable
    and all of these collections had no common interface. and its very musch hassle to handle as each has different
    method to access to his members.
-> Another drawback of being that most of the vector methods are final, so we can't extend the Vector class to
    implement similar kind of Collection.

    Collection Framework Heirarchy:
    I) Collection
    1)Set  -> SortedSet
    2)List
    3)Queue
    4)Dequeue

    II) Map ->SortedMap
