Types of Data Structures
1)Primitive Data Structure
    ->Integer,Float,Character,Boolean
2)Non-Primitive Data Structure
    ->Linear Data Structure -> 1)Array,Linked List, Stack, Queue, Dequeue
    ->Non-Linear Data Structure -> 1)Tree 2)Graphs

-> primitive data Structures represents single value
->Linear Data Structure represents multiple values. it travese the data sequentially. i.e, only one data
    element can be directly reached from the given point.
-> Non-Linear data structure represents multiple values. the way of represeting the data in the structure makes
    access the multiple elements.
